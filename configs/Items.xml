          The .44 pistol is a double-action revolver, chambered to use the .44
          Magnum cartridge. It&apos;s a powerful gun, though not as customizable as
          other handguns. Due to their simple, rugged design, they&apos;re prized by
          their owners, but not so uncomman as to be truly rare.
